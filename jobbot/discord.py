"""Send job alerts to a Discord channel via a free Incoming Webhook.

Setup (one time):
  1. In Discord: Server Settings -> Integrations -> Webhooks -> New Webhook.
  2. Pick the channel, click "Copy Webhook URL".
  3. Set DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL to that URL.
No bot hosting and no cost — Discord just accepts POSTs to the webhook.
