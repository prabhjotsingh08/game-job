"""Send job alerts to your own WhatsApp via CallMeBot (free, no business account).

Setup (one time):
  1. Save the CallMeBot number +34 684 770 005 to your phone contacts.
  2. From your WhatsApp, send it:  I allow callmebot to send me messages
  3. It replies with your personal API key.
  (CallMeBot rotates this number; if it shows as "not on WhatsApp", get the current
   one at https://www.callmebot.com/blog/free-api-whatsapp-messages/)
Then set WHATSAPP_PHONE (your number, with country code) and WHATSAPP_APIKEY.
